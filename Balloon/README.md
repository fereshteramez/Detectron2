# Detectron2
Implementation of object detection and segmentation using Detectron2. 
I have implemented two object detection(segmentation) codes; one shows how to apply a pre-trained model on your own dataset and the other shows how to train your algorithm on a custom dataset (balloon).
You can download the balloon dataset from the link below:
